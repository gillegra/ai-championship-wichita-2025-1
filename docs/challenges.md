# ReSkill KS - Challenge Structure

This document tracks the four challenges that make up the ReSkill KS application. Each challenge has its own sub-route and distinct functionality.

## Overview

ReSkill KS is organized into 4 separate challenges, each accessible via unique routes. This structure allows for modular development and distinct user experiences.

- AI-driven personalized career transition plans
- Progress tracking dashboard with milestones
- 6 AI agent personas (Riley, Taylor, Alex, Jordan, Sam, Casey)

**Key Components**:
- `src/pages/reskill/features/intake/` - Multi-step intake form
- `src/pages/reskill/features/plan/` - Career plan display
- `src/pages/reskill/features/progress/` - Progress tracking

## Implementation Notes

### Routing Strategy

The application uses nested routing structure with each challenge at its own top-level route:

```
/                 - Root redirect to /reskill

/reskill/*        - Challenge 1: ReSkill KS
  /reskill/       - Intake portal (index)
  /reskill/plan   - Career plan view
  /reskill/progress - Progress tracking dashboard
  /reskill/agents - AI agents chat

/game             - Challenge 2: Game (TBD)

/c3               - Challenge 3: TBD

/c4               - Challenge 4: TBD
```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Directory Structure**: Each challenge lives in `src/pages/[challenge-name]/`
   - For example: `src/pages/reskill/`, `src/pages/game/`, `src/pages/c3/`, `src/pages/c4/`
2. **Feature Organization**: Within each challenge, organize features by domain
   - Example: `src/pages/reskill/features/intake/`, `src/pages/reskill/features/plan/`, etc.
3. **Shared Resources**: Common UI components, types, and utilities go in `/src/shared/`
4. **Types**: Each challenge can have its own types at `src/pages/[challenge-name]/types/`
5. **Routing**: All challenge routes defined in main `src/App.tsx` router
6. **Navigation**: Global header should provide navigation between challenges

### When Adding New Challenges

1. Create challenge directory: `src/pages/[challenge-name]/`
2. Create placeholder component at `src/pages/[challenge-name]/Challenge.tsx` (or appropriate name)
3. Add route in `src/App.tsx` router
4. Update this document with challenge details and route
5. Update CLAUDE.md Project Context if introducing new patterns
6. Update main navigation in Header component
7. Create feature subdirectories as features are developed: `src/pages/[challenge-name]/features/[feature]/`

## Team Coordination

**IMPORTANT**: Team members are currently working on updates. Always pull latest changes before making route or navigation modifications.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25 - Routes finalized, placeholder components created, ready for Challenge 3 and 4 implementation
