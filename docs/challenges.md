## Implementation Notes

### Routing Strategy

The application will use nested routing structure:

```
/reskill/*        - Challenge 1 routes
  /reskill/       - Intake portal
  /reskill/plan   - Career plan
  /reskill/progress - Progress tracking
  /reskill/agents - AI agents

/game/*           - Challenge 2 routes (TBD)

/challenge3/*     - Challenge 3 routes (TBD)

/challenge4/*     - Challenge 4 routes (TBD)
```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Isolation**: Each challenge should be self-contained in its own feature directory
2. **Shared Resources**: Common UI components, types, and utilities go in `/src/shared/`
3. **Routing**: All challenge routes defined in main App.tsx router
4. **Navigation**: Global header should provide navigation between challenges

### When Adding New Challenges

1. Update this document with challenge details
2. Create feature directory: `src/features/[challenge-name]/`
3. Add routes in App.tsx
4. Update CLAUDE.md Project Context if needed
5. Update main navigation in Header component

## Team Coordination

**IMPORTANT**: Team members are currently working on updates. Always pull latest changes before making route or navigation modifications.
